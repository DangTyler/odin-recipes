       <h2>Description</h2>

       <p>
            What I love about this recipe is that it’s budget-friendly (assuming you have a few Asian sauces in the pantry already) and it’s ridiculously easy to make. The Thai marinade for the chicken is tangy, sweet and salty, really showcasing that perfect Southeast Asian flavour balance.
       </p>  
       <p>
            The only thing to remember is that these chicken drumsticks are best left to marinate for at least 12 hours. If in a rush, you can leave them in the marinade for an hour but the meat will be more flavourful and more tender, the longer you let it infuse.
       </p>
       <p>
            This chicken drumstick recipe is gluten-free, low-carb, and Paleo-friendly.

            The marinade used in this recipe is the star of the dish. I mean, I baked chicken drumsticks but it could be wings, tenderloins, breasts or any other part of the bird.

        The marinade features ginger, garlic, lime juice and zest, Tamari (or soy sauce), fish sauce, honey and sesame oil, plus a little chili. I LOVE all of these ingredients so I almost always have them on hand and think they are worth purchasing as can will continue to use them.

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
           <li>8 chicken drumsticks</li>
           <li>A dollop of coconut oil or a little olive oil for greasing the tray</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>Mix the marinade in a bowl, then toss the chicken drumsticks in it.</li>
           <li>Marinate the chicken overnight or for about 12 hours (24 is even better).</li>
           <li>Remove chicken from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature before cooking, so about 15 minutes prior.</li>
           <li>Preheat the skillet on high heat. Remove all seasoning from the lamb shoulder chops and add them to the skillet. Cook for about 6 minutes on each side. To verify the readiness of the chops – they should be cooked to 145°F for medium rare, 160°F for medium, or 170°F for well done</li>
           <li>Preheat the oven to 190 C/ 375 F, make sure it’s hot! Grease a flat baking tray with some oil and place the drumsticks on top. Bake for 30 minutes. Use the leftover marinade to baste the chicken halfway through.</li>
       </ol>
